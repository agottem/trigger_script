Building the source:

Trigger Script is built using GNU Make 3.81 or higher.  GNU Make for Windows can found
here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm

The parser and lexer for Trigger Script are generated using GNU Bison 2.4.1 and GNU
Flex 2.5.4a.  Bison can be found here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm and
Flex can be found here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm

NOTE: Some GNU tools for Windows are sensitive to whitespaces in the installation path.  To
      avoid any potential problems, it's recommended you install GNU Make, Bison, and Flex
      to a path such as 'C:\GnuWin32\' instead of 'C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\'.

Trigger Script currently targets the Microsoft Visual C Compiler.  To build, launch a Visual
Studio command prompt, or any command prompt which has the MSVC toolchain available.  Verify
GNU Make, Bison, and Flex are all available in your path.

To start the build, CD to the path where the Trigger Script source is installed.  From that
path, run the following command:

    Prompt> make

Make will build everything, and place the output in the folder named 'build', located at the
root of the Trigger Script source location.  By default, a release build is performed.  If
a debug build is desired, run the command:

    Prompt> make config=debug

The output for debug builds is also directed to the build folder.

Cleaning a build can be done specifying the target 'clean'.  Clean will delete all files
previously built for the specified configuration.  For example:

    Prompt> make config=debug clean
    Prompt> make clean
