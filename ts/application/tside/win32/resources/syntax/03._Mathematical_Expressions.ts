# Mathematical expressions can be formed using the following operators:

#    x + y Adds x and y together
#    x - y Subtracts y from x
#    x * y Multiplies x and y together
#    x / y Divides x by y
#    x % y The remainder of x divided by y
#    x ^ y Takes x to the power of y

# Standard operator precedence is respected.  Expressions can be made up
# of constants, variables, or functions.  For example:

my_var = 5
another_var = my_var + 2 * 3 - my_function()

# Expressions which contain a string may only use the '+' operator, as no
# other operator makes sense in the context of strings.  In the context of
# strings, '+' has the effect of concatonation.
