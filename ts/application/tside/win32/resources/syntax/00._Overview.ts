# There are many fields in which algorithms are largely event driven.
# Trigger Script (TS) is a language that allows novice programmers to
# easily build event driven algorithms.  At the same time, TS can
# interface with code written in other languages such as C or C#, allowing
# experienced engineers to develop more complex functionality.

# Executing a TS program can be done either through the command line tool,
# or through the IDE.  Both the IDE and command line provide a debugger to
# step through TS code and examine variable values.  Additionally, the
# APIs to compile and execute TS programs are designed to be invoked from
# within existing programs.
